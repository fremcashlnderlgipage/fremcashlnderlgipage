Some people are surprised at the lengths a legitimate lender will go to help a borrower repay a debt. For the lender, working with the borrower means it is helping ensure repayment and avoiding the hassle of potential default.

A payment plan means you and the lender agree you will pay the loan at a set monthly amount. While this plan may extend the time it takes to repay your debt, a lower interest rate and extended time would reduce the monthly payment, a big help to those in a cash crunch.

This option is good for those willing to reach out and advocate on their own behalf. Many medical facilities, for example, are more than willing to work out a payment plan, often at no interest. If you have a good history of making payments and have simply fallen on misfortune, a lender may well work with you on a payment plan.

Be sure to keep making at least minimum payments until the payment plan takes effect. And once it does, don’t mess around on payments. Lenders do not take kindly to their largesse being abused.
